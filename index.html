    <h1>BigFoot Sightings</h1>
    
    <h2>Plot 1: BigFoot Sightings by State</h2>
    <div id="viz1"></div>
    <p>I have generated a bar chart visualization representing the frequency of Bigfoot sightings across various states. The chart employs a bar mark for visual representation, with states sorted based on sighting counts. The y-axis encodes the count of sightings, while the bars are colored orange.</p>
    <p>The data contains Bigfoot sighting information, grouped by state and counting sightings. These design choices aim to convey the distribution of sightings effectively, prioritizing clarity and visual appeal.</p>

    <h2>Plot 2: BigFoot Sightings - Frequency by Season and State</h2>
    <div id="viz2"></div>
    <p>I have generated an interactive scatter plot visualization exploring the frequency of Bigfoot sightings by state and season. The plot employs encodings for states on the x-axis, seasons on the y-axis, and frequency of sightings represented by point size, while color distinguishes between seasons. Data was aggregated by state and season using the count function. Interactivity is introduced through a dropdown menu allowing users to filter data by state, enhancing clarity and enabling focused exploration of the dataset.</p>
